# Common Interview Mistakes

## Candidate

### Not being prepared
- **Study open-source projects** - not every project is perfect but you still can learn lots of useful things from each of them.
- **Study company dev blog** - you can learn a lot about their underlying technical stack and think about potential questions they might ask.
- **Conduct mock interviews with your friends** - time management is crucial: your goal is to cover as much ground as possible in the shortest amount of time. Having some practice also eases up the stress from the actual interivew.

### Rushing towards a solution
- **Not gathering system requirements** - the interview question may be purposely vague. The candidate is expected to ask more questions to define the task better. For more information see [Gathering Requirements](https://github.com/weeeBox/mobile-system-design#gathering-requirements).
- **Not asking clarifying questions** - it might be useful to get some information about the target market, the size of the audience, and the dev team details.
- **Jumping straight to implementation** - it's generally a bad sign if the candidate immediately starts discussing low-level topics. For example, which view classes to use or what UI-architecture pattern to apply. The interviewer might not be interested in implementation details in the first place.

### Being unresponsive
- **Keeping silence** - make sure to talk through your solution and not ask the interviewer to give you a few minutes to think.
- **Waiting until the interviewer starts asking questions** - it is preferable for the candidate to "drive" the discussion (especially for more senior candidates).

### Giving up early
A single failure might de-rail the candidate and make them give up the whole interview. This is a poor strategy since most of the interviewers are trying to evaluate the candidate's abilities and not only looking for "correct" answers.

### Talking too much
- **Long introduction** - digging deeper into your professional background does not provide much "signal". The interviewer would most likely form an opinion based on the candidate's interview performance and not the summary of their professional experience.
- **Trying to force an interviewing framework** - the said guide represents a set of recommendations and does not define an official interview protocol for any company. The candidate should follow the interviewer's lead in each particular case.
- Ignoring the interviewer
- Repeating yourself
- Jumping from a topic to a topic
- Going too broad with the answers - covering irrelevant things.

_Note: Cognitive hiring biases are left out of scope for this guide. You can find lots of information on the Internet._

### Not being prepared
_TBD_

### Being toxic
_TBD_
- "Educating" the candidate
- Acting "superior"

### Being unresponsive
- Checking phone
- Eating

### Being overly optimistic
- Suggesting solution

### "Grilling" the candidate
- **Asking narrow sub-domain questions** - a type of questions focusing on specific things the candidate does not need to know to be successful at the job.
- **Trying to corner the candidate** - asking intentionally tough and tricky questions to make the candidate admit they don't know the answer.

### Asking about their owm strong points - not candidate's
_TBD_

### Asking meaningless questions
- "Why did you choose a relational database (ORM) to store structured data that requires complex querying?" - there's little "signal" a candidate can provide here (unless they advocate for text files or user preferences).
- "Why caching/modularization/testing/etc is necessary?"
- "Why would you use an industry-standard library instead of a custom implementation?" - this question might make sense when it comes to framework development but _could_ be meaningless when talking about an app. See "Chapter 21. Dependency Management" from the "Software Engineering at Google" book.

Everything the interviewer asks should help determine if the candidate is a fit for the job. Any other questions should be left out of scope.

### Not moving on when the candidate is stuck
_TBD_

### Forcing the candidate into a solution they have in mind
_TBD_

### Digging too much into details (BFS approach)
_TBD_
