# Common Interview Mistakes

## Candidate

### Not being prepared
- **Study open-source projects** - not every project is perfect but you still can learn lots of useful things from each of them.
- **Study company dev blog** - you can learn a lot about their underlying technical stack and think about potential questions they might ask. For example, there's no need to mention GraphQL at Google interview or Protobuf at Facebook.
- **Conduct mock interviews with your friends** - time management is crucial: your goal is to cover as much ground as possible in the shortest amount of time. Having some practice also eases up the stress from the actual interivew.
