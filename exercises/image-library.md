# Mobile System Design Exercise: Image Library [work in progress]
The task might be simply defined as "Design Image Library". The definition is purposely vague and requires some clarification.

## Gathering Requirements
You are expected to ask clarifying questions and narrow down the scope of the task. This should not take more than 5 minutes.

> **Candidate**: ""  
> **Interviewer**: ""  

Make sure not to overload the system requirements with unnecessary features. Think in terms of MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and pick features that have the biggest value. You can learn more about requirements gathering [here](https://github.com/weeeBox/mobile-system-design#gathering-requirements).

## Functional requirements
- _TBD_

## Non-functional requirements
- _TBD_

## Out of scope
- _TBD_

## Client Public API (Optional)
Your interviewer might want to discuss the client public API. In the simplest form it might look like this:

```
TBD
```

## High-Level Diagram
A high-level diagram shows all major system components and their interactions (without implementation details). You can learn more about high-level diagrams [here](https://github.com/weeeBox/mobile-system-design#high-level-diagram).

_TBD_

### Components:
- _TBD_

## Deep Dive
After a high-level discussion, your interviewer might want to discuss some specific components of the system. Make sure to keep your explanation brief and don't overload it with details - let your interviewer guide the conversation and ask questions instead. You can learn more about deep-dive discussions [here](https://github.com/weeeBox/mobile-system-design#deep-dive-tweet-feed-flow).  

## Follow-up Questions
Some interviewers might ask follow-up questions that might change the original design and introduce new requirements.  

_TBD_

## Major Concerns and Trade-Offs

_TBD_

## Conclusion
- Keep this in mind while preparing for a system design interview:
- Don't try to make it perfect - provide a "signal" instead.
- Listen to your interviewer and keep track of the time.
- Try to cover as much ground as possible without digging too much into the implementation details.
